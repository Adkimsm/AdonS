# AdonS | Easier v6

AdonS(Easier) v6 Edition is rewrited with React.js, Vite.js and Tauri. We didn't use Electron because of its file size. We think that Tauri will help us provide better UX for our users.

> Progress in work.

## Usage

Right now, you can't get AdonS v6 from any ways except GitHub. You have to clone the source code from GitHub and run it localy. Like this:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Kysolva/AdonS.git
$ cd AdonS

$ yarn tauri
```
